I'm a first-year PhD student in the Data Systems Group (DSG) at MIT where I am advised by [Tim Kraska](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska/). Before coming to MIT I worked at Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT) while also pursuing a Master's degree at Stanford under the wonderful guidance of [Daniel Kang](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/ddkang) and [Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/).

I am interested in problems at the intersection of Sytems and Machine Learning.
