I'm a first-year PhD student in the Data Systems Group (DSG) at MIT where I am advised by [Tim Kraska](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska/). Before coming to MIT, I worked at Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT) while also pursuing a Master's degree at Stanford under the wonderful guidance of [Daniel Kang](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/ddkang) and [Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/).

My early PhD work has explored the design and implementation of AI systems which make use of LLMs to (A) execute novel AI workloads and (B) reimagine how to execute traditional data management workloads. In particular, we recently published a [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14696) for [**Palimpzest**](https://github.com/mitdbg/palimpzest), which is a declarative system for optimizing a general class of AI workloads we call *Semantic Analytics Aplications* -- or **SAPPs**. I am also beginning work on a project to assist with software development for large-scale systems over long time horizons (i.e., not just synthesizing a small function, class, or commit).
